# pingpongapp

I made this app mainly out of need. There aren't many apps specifically made with keeping track of score in ping pong in mind. So I decided to make one myself.

v1.0.0 - The current features in this version include a score counter, that incriments up to 11 and then resets, and a set wins counter, that keeps track of how many sets you have won, as well as personalized named. Some upcoming features include, more animations to 'congragulate' the winner of the set, and eventually the winner of the circuit. I also hope to be able to implement a feature that keeps track of who's turn it is to serve. And maybe one day, if I learn back end, a method of keeping a running history of games.
